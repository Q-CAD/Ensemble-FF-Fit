To setup Jax on AMD GPUs on Frontier with the proper plugins, follow the instructions at: https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/software/analytics/jax.html
After cloning the Jax-ReaxFF library at https://github.com/cagrikymk/JAX-ReaxFF/tree/master, delete the CUDA checks in the setup.py. Also, remove the upper version limits on jax and jaxlib (=0.4.30) and on scipy (=1.12.0) to ensure compatibility with jax 0.4.35. NOTE: Jax-ReaxFF is very poorly performant on Frontier's AMD GPUs for large CPU-GPU transfers. This can make fitting nearly impossible for large datasets. We recommend only using Jax-ReaxFF for finetuning with small datasets/structures
